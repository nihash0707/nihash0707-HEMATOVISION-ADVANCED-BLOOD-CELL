# HematoVision: Advanced Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning

## 🧠 Overview
HematoVision is a deep learning web app that classifies blood cell images into four categories using transfer learning. It helps in identifying blood disorders by analyzing microscopic images.

## 🔍 Classes
- Eosinophil
- Lymphocyte
- Monocyte
- Neutrophil

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- VGG16 Pre-trained Model
- Flask Web Framework
- HTML/CSS (for UI)
